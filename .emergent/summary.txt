The trajectory chronicles an extensive development and debugging process for the GoPos F&B POS application. The work began by implementing core features like a sales details page and backend endpoints for refunds and returns. The engineer successfully added these, tested the backend, and moved on to UI/UX enhancements based on user feedback. These included redesigning the checkout modal for better usability and a major overhaul of the printer configuration UI to include device detection simulation, receipt previews, and customization.

Subsequent interactions involved iterative refinement and significant debugging. The engineer adjusted logo sizes, implemented new branding with user-provided assets, and attempted to switch to real Bluetooth printer detection.

A major portion of the work involved a difficult and multi-stage effort to prepare the application for deployment and build an APK. This was fraught with challenges:
1.  A critical misinterpretation led to a complete backend rewrite from MongoDB to SQLite and then a necessary reversion back to MongoDB.
2.  Resolving deployment health-check failures by creating necessary  and  files.
3.  Troubleshooting a series of complex Gradle build failures for the APK, involving Node.js version mismatches, incorrect splash screen paths, and the problematic inclusion of  in production builds.
4.  Diagnosing a login failure in the built APK, correctly identifying that the backend had never been deployed, making it inaccessible from the mobile app.

The latest task was to add a custom app icon and contact information to the About Us page, after which the user confirmed they want to proceed with deploying the backend.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build GoPos, a comprehensive Food & Beverage (F&B) Point of Sale (POS) system for Android.

**Core Functionality:**
-   **Authentication:** Dual-role login for super admin and client users.
-   **POS Dashboard:** A main interface for clients featuring a collapsible sidebar, a horizontal category menu, and a grid of items. Users can add items to a cart, which is accessible via a floating drawer. Long-pressing items allows editing or deletion.
-   **Order & Payment:** The checkout process supports cash (with quick-select amounts and change calculation) and QR code payments, along with percentage-based discounts. It generates printable receipts.
-   **Reporting:** Includes a Day Closing report and a Sales Details page to view transaction history.
-   **Super Admin:** A dedicated dashboard allows the super admin to perform CRUD operations on client accounts.

**Implementation Highlights:**
-   The backend is built with FastAPI and MongoDB, featuring a multi-tenant architecture where data is isolated per client using prefixed collection names.
-   The frontend is an Expo (React Native) application.
-   Recent features added include refund/return functionality, a fully-featured (though initially simulated) printer configuration modal with receipt customization, and an enhanced checkout UI with quick cash amount buttons.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** Expo (React Native),  (file-based routing), , , React Context.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB with  (async driver), JWT for authentication,  for hashing.
- **Architecture:** Full-stack application with a multi-tenant backend (client_id prefixed collections).
- **Build/Deployment:** EAS CLI for building APKs. Deployment process targets a Kubernetes environment, requiring proper  and  files.
- **UI:** Custom UI built with , , and core React Native components.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured into a  Expo app and a  FastAPI server.



- ****
    - **Importance:** The entire API lives here. It handles all business logic, database interaction, and authentication.
    - **Changes:** Endpoints for item returns () and order refunds () were added. It was temporarily rewritten to use SQLite and then reverted to the original MongoDB/motor implementation to fix a deployment-related misunderstanding. A fix was applied to use  instead of  for safer environment variable access.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the core of the client-facing application, containing the main POS interface, cart, and all modals (Checkout, Printer Config, About Us, etc.). It's the most frequently and heavily modified file.
    - **Changes:** The checkout modal UI was significantly enhanced with a wider layout and quick-select cash buttons. A complex, feature-rich printer configuration modal was built from scratch. Logo sizes were adjusted multiple times. The printer detection logic was updated to use . It is pending a text update in the About Us modal.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The application's entry point and login screen.
    - **Changes:** The logo was added and updated multiple times with new assets. The Staff Login text was changed to a bold Client Login, and hardcoded credential hints were removed.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The main configuration file for the Expo app, critical for building the APK.
    - **Changes:** This file was modified multiple times to fix build errors. The splash screen image path was corrected. The app  and  paths were updated to use a new user-provided logo for the APK. The EAS  was added.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Configures the Expo Application Services (EAS) build process.
    - **Changes:** This file was created and modified to resolve native build failures. Key changes include specifying a compatible Node.js version () and creating a new  profile that explicitly excludes development dependencies like  by setting .

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Deploy the backend.** The user explicitly confirmed this (please Deploy it with Option 1.). The application's APK cannot function correctly without a live backend API.
- **Commit and push all recent changes** (About Us update, app icon changes) to the user's GitHub repository so they can pull the latest code and build the final APK.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the final stages of preparing the application for deployment and a new APK build. The user reported that their successfully built APK failed to log in. The engineer correctly diagnosed that this was because the backend was not deployed and therefore inaccessible from the mobile device.

Just before proceeding with deployment, the user made two final requests:
1.  **Add a new home screen icon for the APK.** The AI has already updated  to point to the new logo URL for the  and .
2.  **Add contact info to the About Us page.**

The user then re-iterated the priority: **please Deploy it with Option 1.** The AI engineer acknowledged this and was about to complete the About Us text update before starting the deployment process. The immediate task is to add the contact number to the  file.

<optional_next_step>
Complete the pending edit to  to add the contact information to the About Us modal as requested by the user.
